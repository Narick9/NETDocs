Becoming a hermit near Miyamoto Usagi's village, he later had a confrontation with an arrogant gang
of students from the rival Dogora school, witnessed by Usagi and his rival Kenichi which ended with
a short battle where Katsuichi easily slew his attackers. Usagi was so impressed that he appealed
to the lion to take him as his student, a request that was immediately refused. Only after Usagi
waited outside his home day and night long enough did he convince the teacher that the rabbit was
serious enough for him to change his mind.
