Taking the youth as his student, Katsuichi used unusual techniques to teach the boy. These included
attacking Usagi at random times to encourage Usagi to be constantly vigilant to danger. Usagi
excelled at this instruction and soon became a master warrior skilled enough for Katsuichi to
compete in- and eventually win- a fencing tournament against the Dogora school. Although he does
not make his opinion of students known to their faces, Katsuichi considers Usagi his finest pupil.
